        "1)An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day. In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years: The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless: The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless: The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year. Write function to decide whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False."
